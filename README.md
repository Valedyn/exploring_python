# Learning Python

As part of my continuous development as a software developer, I wish to expand upon my skill set.

Having previously primarily focused on Java, I have decided that learning Python might be beneficial as well, thus this git repository.

This git repository will contain all my Python I have deemed too small to deserve their own git repos.

### Current scripts include:
- Simple expense tracker, not too refined. Used for trying out the singleton pattern in Python, Enums, os-independent file reading of json files, and classes.

### Dependencies
Dependencies are listed at the top of each Python file

### Running
python <script_name_here>.py

Python version used during development was 3.12.0
